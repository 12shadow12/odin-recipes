    <h4>Chinese inspired fried rice</h4>
    <p>Fried egg rice, a simple yet satisfying dish, embodies the essence of comfort food. With its aromatic blend of savory rice and golden-fried eggs, 
        each bite offers a symphony of flavors and textures. The rice, often seasoned with soy sauce, garlic, and a dash of sesame oil, serves as the perfect canvas for the 
        rich, creamy yolk of the fried egg. As the fork gently breaks through the crispy edges of the egg, it releases a cascade of creamy goodness that
         melds with the fluffy grains of rice, creating a harmonious marriage of taste and mouthfeel. Whether enjoyed as a quick weeknight meal or a hearty brunch option, 
         fried egg rice never fails to evoke feelings of warmth and contentment, making it a beloved staple in households around the world.</p>
    <h2>HOMEMADE FRIED RICE INGREDIENTS: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leftover Rice:</strong>
            A fresh batch of warm (or even lukewarm) rice will not fry well when it hits the hot pan, 
            and will result in soggy and sticky clumps. 
            So leftover refrigerated rice is ideal!</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> I have made many a batch of fried rice using various oils, and I’m now convinced there’s 
            a reason why Japanese steak houses use that big slab of butter when they’re making fried rice. It just tastes so much better, 
            and also makes everything brown up perfectly.</li>
        <li><strong>Scramble Eggs:</strong> yummy eggs</li>
        <li><strong>Toasted sesame oil:</strong> It is my favorite smelling ingredient in my kitchen, and tastes wonderful in fried rice. 
            (Also note that sesame oil is meant as a finishing oil, not a cooking oil, so remove the pan from the heat and then stir it in.)</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong>Freshly-minced.</li>
        <li><strong>Oyster Sauce:</strong> This is a major flavor booster in fried rice and (don’t worry) doesn’t taste like oysters. 
            You can find it in the Asian section of grocery stores, or order it on 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00842LTE2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gimmesomeov08-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00842LTE2&linkId=33fa98e042562489f0d47572b4025eb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon.</a></li>
        <li><strong>Carrots, onions, green onions and peas:</strong> veggies go a long way in adding some flavor and freshness</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HOW TO MAKE FRIED RICE STEPS :</h2>
    <p>To make this homeaade fried rice recipe, simply:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Scamble eggs: </strong>Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté veggies and garlic: </strong>Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.</li>
