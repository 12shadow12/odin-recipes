    <h4>Japanese omurice from best country Japan</h4>
    <p>Learn to make a classic-style Japanese rice omelette called Omurice. It’s a home-cooking staple in Japan adored by people of all ages. In my recipe, 
        I’ll teach you how to make a perfectly creamy and custardy omelette to wrap around savory chicken rice.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients for Omurice:</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4><u>For the Omelettes</u></h4>
        <li><strong>4 large eggs</strong></li>
        <li>½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp unsalted butter: </strong>adds a rich and creamy texture to the rice and omelette</li>
        <h4><u>For the Chicken Rice</u></h4>
        <li><strong>cooked japanese short grain rice</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3 oz Boneless, Skinless Chicken thighs:</strong>stays juicier and more flavorful compared to chicken breast</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 onion</strong></li>
        <li><strong> 1 Tbsp green peas</strong></li>
        <li><strong>5 Tbsp ketchup: </strong>The classic seasoning for chicken rice (ketchup rice); I highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kagome-1003-tomato-ketchup-500g/dp/B000GVXFPK?crid=15VFNWRLQ5RN3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CzaeDCLZS8dJTG5zeb33V-aPUSkP7NnWzlBj2NFzrTE8oBI9vP9vt7Npq6rHtQOk__-CZjrFdAQpy-1gCewDyy0BmkcG0MY50bA52Xvfzzom0qIgMvqJtzaKRAxsOT1dLc9kStLRkv6Xi-nov5IP7qORrp6LOajfIg7RUxQ90KyGnUxGwycrmAkTUyToMQDNJLo9zKMQKHRyBCtFAlm8VZ4mJmz024RTHIJgWxtoAMb-Qfbbe1NYDQhzpWnAHw_TaMKfswoAmjVVEPCAyM4zydFmaQnIePdkV5vDPaBF3Xk.NBWVoLjC8iwUhFco9BPs1sJ9VpLb_O0QSod2jePm2Rk&dib_tag=se&keywords=kagome+ketchup&qid=1715110277&sprefix=kagome+ketchup,aps,283&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=jusonecoo-20&linkId=e8db2742f91381610417c86f9cb58aeb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"
             target="_blank" rel="noopener">KAGOME brand Japanese ketchup</a></li>
        <li><strong> 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce: </strong>adds complexity to the rice; you can substitute it with tonkatsu sauce or soy sauce</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make the Best Omurice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the chicken rice:</strong> Stir-fry the chicken and onion, then season them with ketchup. Let the excess moisture evaporate first, then add the steamed rice. Toss to combine and set aside. Alternatively, you can make my Rice Cooker Chicken Rice ahead of time and freeze individual portions so you can start making an omelette right away!</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Beat the eggs and salt and strain them through a fine-mesh strainer. Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the egg mixture. Stir the eggs constantly with a pair of chopsticks while you shake the pan to make soft, small curds.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the omurice:</strong> When the eggs are half-cooked, place the chicken rice in the center of the omelette. Move the pan to a wet cloth to cool it. Wrap both sides of the omelette around the rice in an oval shape. Invert the omurice onto a plate and fix the shape with a paper towel. Pour the sauce or drizzle a zigzag pattern of ketchup onto the omurice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Recipe Tips and Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a small-size, nonstick skillet.</strong> I recommend an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Clad-Stainless-Dishwasher-PFOA-free-Non-Stick/dp/B004ZH3DCQ?crid=3HVHZ48TPFZO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2pBRlHwr5RYVa2NwDIT-FW67J2LU0Yv_Fvps19E3THCVin9hSNS2gAt2MVn-IbggtBl_iIblmPA1hYGu0taMEsfcFrqtapcX4QeYZuXFpgCoMF2CwoWUa4MDgcCC_W1Xh9BYqzD6faLhBswSE2PVHo6dgomeH6Aoq9srK1mBfAyBwZMpoypU4oLAEys0IJ5T82UbT6hO045KOMdWsIsBE8Uj0-VAGixJR-biJF3oNDpvmfPQdafCqIl5ZdUZ-nfzNxYJwW159hbZHKnESqFzHE4ezQGw1FBL7OuhbBy8b_o.H_7JiZ9rdUmCtFl45QFQwztoBRrU3LgfL7SCDFObSNY&dib_tag=se&keywords=non-stick%2B8%2Binch%2Ball%2Bclad&qid=1714973174&sprefix=non-stick%2B8%2Binch%2Ball%2Bcla,aps,187&sr=8-7&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=jusonecoo-20&linkId=c2251dc62f012ebfcf0802bba143a471&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">8-inch (20 cm) nonstick frying pan</a>. If you use a large pan, the egg will spread thin and you’re more likely to crack or tear the omelette. It’s also extremely hard to fold and flip when making a large omurice. 
            I’ve tried using my favorite carbon steel pan, but it was very challenging to make an omelette with a smooth surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain the beaten eggs.</strong> For a silky-smooth omelette, use a fine-mesh strainer to remove the two stringy bands on the yolk called the chalaza. This helps to give the cooked eggs a uniform texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the rice before you add it to the omelette</strong> using the side of a small bowl and a spatula. If you try to shape it into a half moon after adding it to the pan, you might tear the omelette. Proportioning also helps keep the omurice the same size. Gently spread the rice to the sides.</li>

        <li><strong>Stir the eggs quickly in a spiral motion with chopsticks while you shake the pan.</strong> Keep the eggs moving so you end up with soft, small curds and an even exterior surface. I found that chopsticks can create really nice small curds better than a silicone spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop stirring when the eggs are half-cooked.</strong> You want to see a smooth omelette surface, not the chopsticks’ stirring marks. Therefore, stop stirring while the eggs are still rather runny. Tilt the frying pan to spread out the remaining uncooked egg mixture. The egg curds should look creamy, soft-scrambled, and custardy at this stage. You don’t want to overcook them, as they’ll continue to cook a little with the residual heat. Make sure to level the egg curds.</li>

        <li><strong>When the eggs are half-cooked, place the chicken rice</strong> in the center of the omelette. Spread it out to the sides a little. Create a rough football shape without moving and touching the omelette.</li>
        <li><strong>Move the pan to a wet folded cloth to cool it.</strong> This prevents the omelette from browning, ensuring that your omurice is an even pale yellow color. Then, slide the omelette to the far edge from the handle and wrap the rice with omelette from both sides.</li>

        <li><strong>Tilt a plate and hold the frying pan upside down at an angle</strong> o flip the omurice onto the plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a paper towel to shape the omurice.</strong> Once you invert it onto a plate, place a paper towel on top and gently mold it with your hands into the shape of a rugby ball.</li>
